/**
 * The standalone HTTP backbone service (CAU-5).
 *
 * One shared server (ADR-C9), HTTP+JSON over localhost (CAU-2 verdict),
 * stateless. It is a THIN transport over an in-process {@link Backbone} (default:
 * a fresh {@link InMemoryBackbone}): the router only routes, parses the JSON
 * body, calls the backbone, and maps results/errors to status+JSON. It does NOT
 * re-validate inputs — the backbone is the single validation authority
 * (see `./wire-errors.ts`).
 *
 * **Security posture (v0).** WRITES are token-gated; READS are open within the
 * trust boundary (ADR-C9). The three write routes — `POST /channels`,
 * `/append`, `/claim` — require a bearer token that resolves in the configured
 * {@link TokenMap}; the server then ANCHORS the resolved identity onto the
 * message (overwriting any client-supplied `agent_id`/`owner`/`created_by`), so
 * the stored `owner` cannot be forged (ADR-C7, CAU-13). Reads and `/healthz`
 * are tokenless — the read-only hook stays open. **Fail-closed:** an
 * EMPTY/unset token map authorizes NOBODY, so with no `CAUCUS_TOKENS` ALL writes
 * return `401`. Bind localhost only; the listener is still unauthenticated for
 * reads, so do not expose the port off-host.
 *
 * The HTTP method/route handlers are `createChannel`, `listChannels`,
 * `describeChannel`, `subscribe`, `append`, `readSince` (CAU-5/CAU-6), and
 * `claim` (CAU-7). The claim route answers BOTH outcomes — `granted` and
 * `already_claimed` — as normal 200 results (the conflict is a value carrying
 * the holder, never an error envelope); the
 * {@link import("./http-client.js").HttpBackbone} client mirrors this.
 *
 * **Artifact routes (CAU-100, ADR-C14).** `PUT/GET
 * /channels/:channel/artifacts/:sha256` carry RAW BYTES, not JSON, so they take
 * a DEDICATED branch ({@link handleArtifactRoute}) BEFORE the JSON body
 * buffering: the PUT (token-gated like `append`) buffers bytes with its own
 * incremental {@link MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES} cap (413 mid-stream, never the 256 KB
 * JSON cap), and the GET (tokenless like `readSince`) serves the blob as opaque
 * `application/octet-stream`. They never touch the JSON parser or the JSON
 * `send` helper.
