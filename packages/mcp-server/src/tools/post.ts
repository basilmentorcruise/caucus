/**
 * `caucus_post` + `caucus_post_finding` + `caucus_steer` — the write tools
 * (CAU-10; `caucus_steer` is CAU-99).
 *
 * `caucus_post` emits any non-`claim` typed message; `caucus_post_finding`
 * fixes `type: "finding"` and `caucus_steer` fixes `type: "steer"` (a
 * human-injected directive, ADR-C13) so neither can be mistyped. All three
 * route through {@link CaucusSession.post}, so identity is stamped server-side
 * (ADR-C7) — a steer is anchored to the relaying session's agent_id/owner, which
 * is exactly "whose human steered" — and a `claim`-typed message can never reach
 * this path (claims are CAU-11, and the `type` enum below excludes `"claim"`).
 *
 * Two invariants:
 * - **ADR-C6 (quiet by default):** the descriptions tell the model to post
 *   sparingly — consequential signal, not chatter.
 * - **ADR-C12 (secret hygiene):** the channel is a shared, persisted log. The
 *   descriptions forbid secrets, and on a rejected post we propagate the
 *   backbone's value-free error untouched — we never interpolate `body` or any
 *   argument into an error string.
